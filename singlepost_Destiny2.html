				<h3>Destiny 2: Amazing Free-To-Play Game!</h3>

				    Destiny 2 is a casual repetitive game that takes place in the future of outer space where the player is free to roam around on different planets. There are three different classes to choose from with each character having unique strengths and weakness. The gameplay between the three classes does not massively affect your playstyle unless when competing against other players. When playing against a real person the special attacks need to be timed with the right combos to successfully defeat the opponent. However, Destiny 2 is mostly a shooter looting game that takes some RPG and MMO elements into the gameplay. This formatting provides the consumer with a lot of choices in terms of how they want to play the game. 
				</p>

					The game itself is full of other players doing their own thing. The downside though, is that these online players do not take advantage of the in-game chat features which makes the place feel ironically empty. Destiny 2 has been trying to counter this dilemma by assuring that most of the missions can be completed through solos. To find people who are willing to utilize the chat features and play as a team, is going to require some additional work. Best place to start would be looking into Destiny 2 FaceBook Groups to connect with like-minded players. After the extra work to seek out additional players, is when the user can enjoy the full aspects of the game.

                <p>
                    Overall, I would say this game is worth checking out despite some of the drawbacks that this game is currently facing. It is simply a game with stunning graphics and amazing first-person shooter gun play mechanics. The story of this game is not favored by many players but the game onto itself has a lot of additional content to keep players busy. Lastly, it may be worth mentioning that this game is free to play on all platforms and has cross saving options. The only thing that cost money in this game would be the additional add-ons and in-game stores that sell special limited items.
